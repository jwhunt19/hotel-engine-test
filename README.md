## GitHub Repo Finder

A search engine designed to search repositories on GitHub based upon the user input. 

Results can be sorted by either **Best Match** (default) or **Stars**. Upon search, you may also filter based upon the languages present in the results.

To view further details about any one repository, click on it to visit the details page where you can find more detailed information, a button to visit the repository on GitHub, and a back button in the top left to return to your search where you left off.
